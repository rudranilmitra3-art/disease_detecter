## 📌 Project Overview

This project is designed as part of the *VIT-Bhopal flipped course evaluation* to demonstrate how basic programming concepts can be used to:

- Collect user input (symptoms, name, age, date)
- Match symptoms with a predefined set of 30 common diseases
- Print the *most probable disease, **suggested medicines, and **diagnostic tests*
- Generate a *simple prescription-style output* in the console

The logic is implemented in pure Python using conditional statements, loops, and simple list operations.

## ✨ Features

- *Symptom Selection*
  - Displays a combined list of symptoms related to multiple diseases.
  - Users manually enter symptom names one by one.

- *Dynamic Symptom Input*
  - Users can keep entering symptoms until they choose to stop.

- *Disease Detection Logic*
  - Counts how many symptoms match each disease.
  - Identifies the disease with the *maximum symptom match*.
  - Handles up to *30 different diseases*, such as:
    - Common Cold, Influenza, Malaria, Dengue, Typhoid, Tuberculosis, Pneumonia  
    - Asthma, COVID-19, Diabetes, Hypertension, Heart Attack, Stroke  
    - Jaundice, Hepatitis, Chickenpox, Measles, Mumps, Migraine  
    - Anemia, Arthritis, Kidney Stones, Gastritis, Hyperthyroidism, Hypothyroidism  
    - Cholera, Rabies, Polio, Skin Fungal Infection, Food Poisoning

- *Prescription-Style Output*
  - Prints:
    - Hospital/Institute name (VIT-BHOPAL)
    - Date
    - Patient Name and Age
    - Expected Disease
    - Suggested medicines (only to be taken *after tests are positive*)
    - Suggested medical tests for confirmation

- *Simple Console-Based User Interface*
  - Fully text-based, runs in any Python-supported environment.
